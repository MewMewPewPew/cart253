Mini me (without arms)

Ash Oest O'Leary


## Description

Probably an alternate version of me that exist. 
I tried to mixed how I look visually, with the basic human features, my piercing and my online face I make :3, as well as some things I love like cats, stars, lined pattern and the ability to put makeup (eyeliner) and to change it often.

I recommend using the pressed mouse to draw anything creative on my mini me.
