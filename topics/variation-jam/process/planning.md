# Planning !
## memory card game variations 

## Starting with the Tarot variation
- Start by deciding what card should be use, then choose temporary pictures to represent them
- Add the tarot json for inspo (and futur telling stuff that could be added)
- look at the base code, make variable of each pair if not already done
- attribute proprieties to each like "gameWin" or "gameOver"
- make a restart button 
- add futur telling text when one pair is revealed with json
