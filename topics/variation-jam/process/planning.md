# Planning !
## memory card game variations 

## Starting with the Tarot variation

1. Add the tarot json for inspo (and futur telling stuff that could be added)
2. Start by deciding what card should be use, then choose temporary pictures to represent them
3. look at the base code, make variable of each pair if not already done
4. attribute proprieties to each like "gameWin" or "gameOver"
5. make a restart button ?
6. add futur telling text when one pair is revealed with json
7. Add Instruction/explanation before the game is launched


    2. deciding what card should be use, then choose temporary pictures to represent them:

    - The sun(19*) = winning, 
    - The magician(1) = The game does not end,
            Gaining 4 objects (sword, wand, cup, coin/pentacle)... why not? The game does not end
    - The hermit(9) = The game does not end,
            Chooses to be alone, maybe disappears on a pelrinage after beging pick up and gives advice to user
    - Death(13)= losing + Keeps magician objects if there
    
            Ideas :
    - instead of having 1 pair of hermits, have 1 hermit + 1      Wheel of fortune(10) = randomly either win or lose 

                The Chariot = winning fast ! go go go
                Tower = losing - magician objects if there
                Strengh = gain the power to :hover and see the card? or smt else ?
                The lovers = ? 
                The Devil = ? temptation
                The Moon = ? anxious
