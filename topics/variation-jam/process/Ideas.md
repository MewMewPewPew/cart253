## Brief 
    https://pippinbarr.com/cart253/assignments/variation-jam/
    Start with an existing simple experience create a minimum of three distinctive variations on that experience. Your starting point can be a previous project, including frogfrogfrog or something completely new.

    Have a menu like the Variations Menu

    Document the variations in README.md
        Attribute all borrowed code in it as well

## Evaluation  
    Project includes clear and descriptive commits across the project timeline that also often show insight into programming practice

    Shows a good engagment with JavaScript and p5 to create a compelling project.

    Project shows excellent engagement with creative exploration through programming.

# IDEAS variations 1
Start with normal/simple chess + add at least 3 :
    https://editor.p5js.org/D_Snyder/sketches/CIZyBpf9k
    
- Revolution chess: 
    Where the pawns don't want to die for the cause and rebel. The form an union against the bourgeoisie, the goal for them is to kill both kings. Goal for the bourgeoisie is to kill all pawns (and traitor?).
    All the pawns (and fou/bishop?) start in the middle. Is it even possible to win ? 
    Maybe (chaos chess), the pawns can always move twice and also go back ? (+ turn into queens)
        
- Chaos chess: 
    place the pieces where ever you want. What happends to eating pieces? What's the goal ? chaos ? a bit like revolution... could merge ideas 

- Pandemic chess: 
    one pawn (or other piece? Not the king obviously) of each kingdom randomly gets sick. The piece must quarantine by moving 2 tiles from other pieces, if too close to any other pieces after (2?) rounds, it gets sick. Make the sick piece turn light green/dark green and (with less power ability to move ?) and/or make the sick piece die after (6?) turn. 

- Music chess: 
    make each 64 squares tiles correspond to a note/sound. 
    Devide octave in tones (7) or demi-tones (12)?
    1-a could be a low Do, following 1-b is Re,... 1-h is then Do but an higher octave (*1)
    2-a would then be Re*1,
    3-a = Mi*2
    4-a = Fa*3
    5-a = Sol*4
    6-a = La*5
    7-a = Si*6
    8-a = Do*7
    Maybe each pieces are different sounds
    Make different sound systems ?? No to eurocentrism !!
        Felling inspired by Gamelian music (which started in Java! now has 3 categories: Balinese/Javanese/Sudanese) but it might be too complicated ...
        look for other non-chromatic scales or tuning system

            https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/cahbts/what_are_some_nonchromatic_scales_that_have_more/
    
    What's the goal ? Do you play normally and then see what it sounds like ? 
    Or maybe the goal is to make music, add element of time

## Memory Card Game
 variations ideas: 

    - Anti-memory game : where you need to NOT pick the same card (not super original)

- Tarot memory game : a mix of memory game & tarot
        where you need to find the fortune you want to happend (Good fortune or the sun = good hapiness, winning. As opposed to death = cycle end, beggining of a new one (restart lol). Other card could have different outcome. The goal to win is to find the pair of suns, the goal to have fun is to discover what each pairs does. It would be fun to add little fortune telling quote (json))

- Music memory game : Turn it into Simon says typa game ? 
        or match the same tone (or + difficult match the sound and not the tone)


    - guess who ? so the cards are all reveiled* and theres a random description (json)    
        then the user need to pick the right one based on that (where's the memory part?)
