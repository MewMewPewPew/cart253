## Description

Save the world, Frog is a game about a frog who's under a lot of pressure. His pond is invaded by invasive toxic flies that threatened his ecosystem. Luckily Frog is hungry and sets a goal to eat all of the flies to protect his home from being polluted. 

One thing thought, is that the flies are also a bit toxic to Frog. He needs to be careful not to poison himself and die. Fairies have healing propreties when eaten, but they are important to the ecosystem and eaten them pollutes aswell. 

Instructions:
Move the frog with your mouse
Click to launch the tongue
Catch flies to keep the pollution low, but be careful because they poison you aswell (slowly)
Catch fairies to heal, but eating them cause a bit of pollution
Keep your health high and pollution low to survive
