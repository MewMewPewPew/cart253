# Mod Jam ideas

1. add poisonous flies that makes the frog sick or something
    - Change the look of the poisonous/evil fly with color (and/or add an angry face), if the frog eats it, he gradually turn purple, more and add a sweating or uncomfortable sign of distress. After some time or if he eats a good fly again, turn back to normal. Eating too much bad flies gives a game over (death).

2. add sound (soudtrack and sound effects)
    - Add fun background music (or nature sound), add sound effects when a fly is eating like a 'mlem' like yoshi does. The music could accelerate or change the more flies the frog eats.  

3. add hunger bar of the frog 
    - Start with a half filled bar of the frog's hunger maybe under at the exterior the canva ? or on the side. With time, hunger bar decreases. Each fly eaten increase the bar. 
    If the bar is full, add a life (<3 heart) near the bar. If the bar is empty then either the frog loses one life, if no more life - Game over. 

4. add animation(dance) if the frog eats a big number amount of flies
    - If the frog eats lots amount of flies (100), make the frog seem happy by making it levitate, spin and finally smile with light coming from it's belly in the middle of the screen. No flies in that moment. Would be either calculted with a score (boring) or with adding gradual yellow blushes on the cheeks of the frog. Could be added as a way to switchs level, make the game harder to eat flies after? Reaching the next animation requires lot more amount of flies. 

5. add obstacle that arrives vertically, that the frog need to avoid
    - Frog are known to jump, make it jump with right click. Add branches or pollution object like cans or plastic blobs that arrives vertically. If the frog can't avoid them, make it disapear with the object and either do a Game Over - death from pollution - or instead make it reappear with flashes like they do in other games. Should he have a live count ? or just have the frog live infinitly ? He technically is already jumping on water like a little god. Maybe an obstacle could be a hand that's trying to capture the frog. 

6. add ripples in the water when the frog moves
    - I would make a drawing of ever growing circles (only a draker blue stroke) and slowly lowering the opacity that would follow the mouvement of the frog under it to create more an effet of water 

7. make the water turn to red the more the frog eats flies
    - gives a more sinister vibe to game, make each fly increase the opacity of red over the blue water (I want to try to avoid making the water purple). Why does eating flies turn the water into blood ? I would say it's because the frog turns a bit crazy, he feels guilt but cannot stop (because of the user). It is then his vision that changes. How can I express this better ? Adding a filter of distortion or something, or adding a sanity bar tha increases and turns the water into blood the when 'too much flies are eaten'. (What's a normal amount of flies to be eaten?) Maybe turn the fly into candy or something more sinister ?

8. add a score, but write the total population of flies that decreases when the frog eats one
    - maybe the frog's goal is to eat all flies because he hates them. We see first a video or little text explaining his origin story of how flies have killed his wife and son and then made fun of him. Once it is achieved (eating all the population of flies) - You Won, revenge is the answer ! I would add little mean faces on the flies.

9. make the speed of the flies faster (harder) the more the frog eats flies
    - for each fly eaten, += 1 or more speed to the flyes, If too many flies complete the width, -= the speed. When will the game stop ? The goal is to find balance ? 

10. when the frog's tongue touches flies, it instead starts a disscution where the flies has to beg for it's life - the user decides if it gets to live or get eaten
    - For this, either the time or flies would need to stop arriving, or it would add pressure to the user. I would make multiple various dialogues (more is better) that would be attributed to random for each fly intercepted. Maybe add a zoom on the fly ? Some exemple of dialogues : "I have children to feed!","I'm preggo with an eggo bro", "I'll give you 2 $ if you to spare me", "I have been waiting for this moment all my life"," You are SO mean !" I do not consent to this." Good evening Frog ", "You will be hearing from my lawyers ..." The decision of either accepting the bargain (sometime nothing) or to eat is chosen by the user with buttons. Dialogue could be made more complicated with more back and forth exchanges. Some decision to either eat or not could impact the game later on, like a fly saying "U ATE MY HUSBAND DEVIL GUY!" or lawyers suing you.  It can be fun to add consciousness and personify the flies I think it adds a lot of possibilities. 

11. flies have different attributes that, when eaten, changes the frog ( ex: color, giggling, speed)
    - Like kirby a little. If pink fly is eaten then turn frog pink. Or If a shaking fly is is eaten then the frog starts to shake.  Attribute are added un to each other unless it changes it's state for a variation of a fly attribute (like if pink frog eats a a green fly then it turns green). The frog is an empath

12. add eyebrows and eye to give expression to the frog
    - His pupil dialte the closer the tongue is to touch a fly. If he eats a fly, eyebrow rise a bit and return to normal. If he misses a fly, he gets sad eyebrows. To much misses and he gets angry eyebrows.

13. add thinking bubbles of random (or not random?) thoughts the frog has or images 
    - could add a fun contrast to have such a silly game with a frog asking himself sometimes philosophical question ( maybe even braking the 4th wall? ). Add a thinking bubble shape, with text that randomly changes each time. Exemple of thought : " meow ", "Why am I eating flies?", " I wonder where are the other frogs" That one was sour [the fly]" " why can't I control my body? "... 

14. maybe the frog eat could other stuff than flies, whatever touches the frog's tongue it eat... like potential sun or score board
    - the game would need to have more element so that the frog can feed (a horizon). Instead of making the stuff disappear, make it attach to the tongue until it's close to the mouth. After a while, the frog is only surrounded by the void. 

15. make the frog move around all sides of the screen: bottom, right and top, but not left because the flies are coming from that direction
    - could be fun to make the canva a circle or an ellipse to mimic a pond, and add some water lilies. make to position of the frog constrained to the edges, but still following the mouse. 

16. give the frog power-up if the frog eats a big number or flies like: multiply, bigger tongue. maybe the power-up aren't helpful. 
    - Eating flies gives them energy, it is shown by making th frog glow (yellow), adding a opacity for each eaten. After a level is acheived, I would make the frog multiply, by adding a second and smaller frog near it and doing the same movement. The second power-up is that the frog as 2 tongue. The third tho is that the lighting of the energy is too powerful and blinds the user a bit (overlay opacity)...

17. make the frog follow a fast evolution after a while of eating flies ( like game spore?)
    - the frog starts small, the more it eats, the bigger it becomes. After lots, of eating, the flies aren't enough. De-zoom the game and make other bigger insect or event little frog be the pray of the frogfrogfrog. When does it stops? The Frog ends up eating the universe... You win ! (or lose ?)

18. add a currency of flies so that the frog (or user) can buy customization (clothes accesories... power-ups?)
    - Yes the frogs have develloped respect point for each fly eaten. score = currency. You can exanche the respect points for silly accessories. 

19. add gambling, give random gifts or tickets for logging in, then make a wheel of fortune that gives either luck or bad luck - customization 
    - Add even more currencies that you can buy with real money !! Flies can randomly drop tickets (or given with logging in). With tickets, play the wheel of fortune that like give you a random outcome : more tickets, accessories, power-up like speed or to be bigger size or power-down like less speed or smaller size. 

20. make the weather (enviroment) change, rain, storm, night, snow ? -maybe humans have started a construction of sort where the pond of the frog lives 
    - For rain you add random blue lines falling, white dot for snow. do it more intensly for storms. Add lots of shade for the night. (I don't know how to do the human construction, my brain is tired)

21. maybe it's the flies VS the frog 
like invaders ?

22. The frog is trying to prevent the flies from reaching the other side ( it is not about eating anymore) Why did the fly cross the pond ?
