-   The instruction screen is short & sweet, maybe a bit too simple in my subjective. 
    I like the frog with it’s eyes and mouth wide open like pressuring me to start the game. Once started I saw the nice background visuals added with the gradient and the shapes forming lily-pads and clouds. It is interesting that the yellow coloured fly changes the colour of the frog, I wonder why? I wish the tongue would go out of the mouth of the frog... unless the red dot wasn’t supposed to be a mouth but something else? The ending with the frog infinitely spinning into the void is funny to me, I like it. One thing I would fix is that to let the user reach a higher score than 8. I would “win” as soon as my score reached 8, I really tried to beat it with no success.

-   I like “THE 21st CENTURY FROG GAME” as a title with the “FROG” in green to show the importance.
    The instructions seemed easy, but after playing I wish I had more context to understand what was going on. The sound adds a nature vibe to the game. The flies movements and sizes were really surprising in a good way reminding a real fly that don’t only move in a += x direction and can be really hard to catch. There is 2 modes, one more relaxed with the blue sky and clouds and the other with an orange sky, fast clouds and big drops of water falling. It was a good idea to offer different modes, but I wonder what was the reason behind the choices of them. I later understood it's supposed to be a storm, maybe if the background color would of been gray or something it would of made more "sense",but who am I to jugde artistic choices. I admire him trying something new. The addition of the score points of the flies was a bit confusing, but I like the idea that it slowly goes down to 0, which gives a game over. The ending screen is pretty but maybe not that relevant to the game. After reading the “README”, I realized that the frog had glasses and I love that. The title screen didn’t show up on my computer, it is also very beautiful.

-   The changing colour strokes of the titles made the game attractive reminding me of an ad we can  find on the internet. I like the double waves of the water moving. The instruction are clear except for “Birds can heal the frog, but it also damages the frog at the same time”. I think it is super compelling to have a day/night cycle with the timer visual, it adds realness to game. I really tried to win, but everytime I would die at the same place because of the flashlight would randomly appear on me and kill me. I found that a bit frustrating. I like the visual of the game over screen. Overall a very good idea.
