    I found her Art-jam super cute to start, with the heart on the background and the blush on the cheeks. The shapes where clearly added with intention to create a person. The blinking is shown by changing the height of the eyes. It's smart, but also a bit creepy, with the fact that the character doesn't seem to have clothes. I like the mouth moving size according to the mouse position, it's fun. Reading the README was nicely detailed and made me notice the "blishing girl" blushing over time, a small feature that brings everything together. The README description made me realized how this should be done. Although the small spelling error which I'll let pass since I know English is not her first language, this project is short and sweet and it was a nice experience after all.

    The README is really insightful on the idea of the project with the semi-realistic rendering of a photo taken by his mom. It was nice to see the process, what was more of a challenge with chrome and how he tried to fix it. The result of Yann’s Art-jam is something beautiful and dynamic. He really took the concept of time which was a requirement for this project, and applied it to himself growing older. This was showed with the hair turning grey and then white. The positioning is also original with a video of a person running around the earth space-time in the background. A fun interactive moment was that if you pressed on the second image bellow, a music starts to play with the addition of wrinkles on his face, a nice reference of time and getting old again. The music did made me wonder and appreciate someone else preferences and really suprised me. I did run into the "chrome bug" the first time opening it in class which is unfortunate. The motion and concept of time is super present and cool. The composition was definitively well-tough and interesting but I still dislike it a bit for stylistic reasons. I don't understand why put 3-4 borders around an image and the date was sometimes illegible because of the video behind and the positioning. Overall, I find it really cool how many ellipses and lines he used to create a more realistic auto-portrait. This project was probably very time-consuming and it inspires me.

    Xa Yuan’s art-jam is also pretty cute and fun, this time we see a whole body in a chibi style. The eye following the mouse is always a fun touch. I actually found myself having way to much fun with making the eyes follow the mouse trying to make them squint. The focused circle, that when moved, makes the user discover icons of things she likes (I assume) is a smart way to present herself. The interactiveness of the mouse click that leads to changing another cloudy background is also fun but I do wonder if there's a meaning of it; does she like clouds as well? The project was fun and nice overall, though I’m not sure what the time element was. I also kinda wished the icons would lead to more individual interactivity.
