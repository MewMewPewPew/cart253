    I found her Art-jam super cute to start, with the heart on the background and the blush on the cheeks. The shapes where clearly added with intention to create a face. The blinking is shown by changing the height of the eyes. It's smart but also a bit creepy, with the fact that the character doesn't seem to have clothes. I like the mouth moving size according to the mouse position, it's fun.

    The idea of Yann’s Art-jam is interesting. He really took the idea of time and applied it to himself growing older. This was showed with the hair turning gray and then white. The positioning is also original with a video of a person running around the earth space-time in the background. One thing I found that might sadly be a bug is how major shapes of his second portrait bellow disappeared after some time. I don’t think it was planned this way. I find it really cool how many ellipses and lines he used to create a more realistic auto-portrait. It was probably very time-consuming but does inspires me to do the same (if I had lots of time). Overall very fun Art-Jam, I like the fact that he seems immortal even thought his hair is white.

    Xa Yuan’s art-jam is also pretty cute, this time we see a whole body chibi style. The eye following the mouse and with a focused circle, that when moved, we discover things she likes ( I assume).
